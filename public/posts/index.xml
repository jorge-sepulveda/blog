      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;time-to-make-a-third-blog&#34;&gt;Time to make a third blog&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have begun my journey of making a blog for the third time. My previous attempts we&amp;rsquo;re unsuccessful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-first-attempt&#34;&gt;The first attempt&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My very first attempt was a simple site done with HTML and CSS. This must&amp;rsquo;ve been during high school for a class assignment and quickly forgot about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was moving from Texas to Phoenix, I found my old stash of hard drives and thought, &amp;ldquo;Hey, I should plug these in and cruise down memory lane!&amp;rdquo; It was perfect as I had found a great opportunity to procastinate packing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I found the site and didn&amp;rsquo;t do anything, I just left it in the same flash drive&amp;hellip;which may have been lost by this point. Pour one out for the lost bits of my first website.&lt;/p&gt;
