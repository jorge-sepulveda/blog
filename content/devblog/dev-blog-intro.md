While making the blog(for the third time of course) I've decided to separate any coding/technical blogs in here. I'll use this as a diary for progress on my repositories.

I must say, I sometimes have the attention span of a squirrel and will randomly learn new things from all the languages or libraries that I play with. I'm sure to have fights with Hugo but I will win them and posts about.
