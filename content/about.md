# Welcome to Jorge Sepulveda's Site

Howdy!

I'm Jorge Sepulveda and I'm a Security Data Engineer at PowerDB, building out our SOC2 Compliance program after building an Identity Program in Oil & Gas.

I started my career as a Software Engineer in American Express but I have since branched out in Systems Administation, Cybersecurity and my favorite, databases. 

I love computers and more importantly, making them work. Taking complex systems and simplifying them is incredibly rewarding. 

I have a B.A in Computing from Texas A&M University with a specialization in Geographic Information Systems(GIS). To summarize that, I'm a computer nerd who likes maps.
