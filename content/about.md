# Welcome to Jorge Sepulveda's Site

Howdy!

I'm Jorge Sepulveda and I'm currently a Senior Security Operations Engineer at Western Midstream, I'll be leading the Identity and Access Management efforts and drive new cybersecurity policies along the way. 

I've worked in Oil & Gas for a year, starting with being a Systems Administrator for BXG systems, a control systems integrator. I also did work on PLC's with Ladder Logic and HMI development for Rockwell's FactoryTalk products.

Before O&G, I worked at American Express as a backend developer contributing and maintaining the payment network, all the magic that happens while swiping your card at stores. I led development for support of the UK payments for my specific microservice in the architecture. I worked with SRE to troubleshoot application logs and spent numerous hours with data engineers to ensure our models we're scalable and fitting all of the different regional markets' use cases.

I know that's a lot of varied skills in cybersecurity, control systems and development but I'm a passionate technologist whose main goals is to make sure computers behave!

I have a B.A in Computing from Texas A&M University with a specialization in Geographic Information Systems(GIS). To summarize that, I'm a big computer nerd who likes maps.
