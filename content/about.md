# Welcome to Jorge Sepulveda's Site

Howdy!

I'm Jorge Sepulveda and I'm currently a sysadmin for BXG systems, a control systems integrator in Oil and Gas.

Previously, I used to work at American Express as a backend developer, contributing and maintaining the payment network, all the magic that happens while swiping your card at stores.
