# Welcome to Jorge Sepulveda's Site

Howdy!

I'm Jorge Sepulveda and I'm currently a SysAdmin for BXG systems, a control systems integrator in the Oil and Gas industry. I also do work on PLC's with Ladder Logic and HMI development for Rockwell's FactoryTalk products.

Previously, I worked at American Express as a backend developer contributing and maintaining the payment network, all the magic that happens while swiping your card at stores. I lead development for support of the UK payments for my specific microservice in the architecture. 

I have a B.A in Computing from Texas A&M University with a specialization in Geographic Information Systems(GIS). To summarize that, I'm a big nerd who likes maps.
