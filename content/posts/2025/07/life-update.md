# I'm still around!

Hey everyone! It's been a long time since I posted and the blog has been a little lonely. We gotta fix that with different posts. I will start with a couple of life updates. I finally hung my spurs of being a sysadmin for natural gas plants and became a Senior Security Operations engineer at Western Midstream! My main goal is heading up the Identity Access Management efforts. 

It's been a lot of fun and a lot of learning and I'm excited to grow into this area. What that means for the future of the blog is...no real changes, just posting about my code and a little bit of sysadmin ocassionally. I made a decision not to post about my cybersecurity learnings and applications. If I'm posting about how I solved X vulnerability with Y solution, I believe that will help others but I'm also giving away the game of my company's security posture. My job is to increase it, not decrease it. 

I hope everyone's been doing good and I plan to crank out more posts in the future!
