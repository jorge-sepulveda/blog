# Third time's the charm

I have begun my journey of making a blog for the third time. My previous attempts we're unsuccessful.

## The first attempt

My very first attempt was a simple site done with HTML and CSS. This must've been during high school for a class assignment and quickly forgot about it. 

When I was moving from Texas to Phoenix, I found my old stash of hard drives and thought, "Hey, I should plug these in and cruise down memory lane!" It was perfect as I had found a great opportunity to procastinate packing.

I found the site and didn't do anything, I just left it in the same flash drive...which may have been lost by this point. Pour one out for the lost bits of my first website.

## Docker-ifying the second attempt

Sometime last year, I tried making the same thing with HTML and CSS and was pretty happy with the design. The color scheme of this site was similar to the CSS file I had written. 

I don't know why but for some reason, I attempted to put the site in a docker container. I got the whole thing going but then I realized Github Pages won't host it and I wasn't looking to pay the 10-15 required dollars a month to host it elsewhere. Maintaining it didn't sound too hard but laziness consumes me so I didn't see myself committing to that. Remember: It pays to do research!

## Fast Forward to the third attempt

I was browsing NetworkChuck's videos and he made a tutorial with Hugo and Markdown. This was perfect for me as I use Markdown A TON and the maintenance would be updating a git submodule every once in a while. I followed his tutorial except for the Obsidian stuff, another tutorial on hosting a Hugo site to Github Pages and Voila! 

A nice terminal theme where I can post my markdown files and host it on Github Pages for the acceptable price of 0 dollars a month. 

The only modification I needed to make from hugo was this container size. It was only 800 ish pixels long so I removed that to make use of the screen's real estate. Mobile friendly too!

All that's next is to finally christen this site with a domain name. I have been paying for my name.dev for 3 years(funny how I was ok with paying for that but fuggedabout hosting fees)

I think now is the time to learn how to slap my name on the interwebs.

I'll share the link to the video I used for [reference](https://youtu.be/dnE7c0ELEH8?feature=shared). If I can build a website, so can you!
