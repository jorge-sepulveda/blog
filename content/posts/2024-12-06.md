# Time to make a third blog

I have begun my journey of making a blog for the third time. My previous attempts we're unsuccessful.

## The first attempt

My very first attempt was a simple site done with HTML and CSS. This must've been during high school for a class assignment and quickly forgot about it. 

When I was moving from Texas to Phoenix, I found my old stash of hard drives and thought, "Hey, I should plug these in and cruise down memory lane!" It was perfect as I had found a great opportunity to procastinate packing.

I found the site and didn't do anything, I just left it in the same flash drive...which may have been lost by this point. Pour one out for the lost bits of my first website.
